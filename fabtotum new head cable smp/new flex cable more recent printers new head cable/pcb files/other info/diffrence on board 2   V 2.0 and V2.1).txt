diffrence on board 2   V 2.0 and V2.1

diffrence is that gnd and Vcc are switched on connector D2 and P7
this was diffrent from the original headboard on V2.0.

on V2.1 this is fixed. On V2.1 connections are exactly the same as 
the original new version of the fabtotum head board for as far as i know.
